## SDK Fabric

> SDK Fabric provides an open infrastructure to automatically generate SDKs for every API.

The [SDK Fabric](https://sdk-fabric.org/) project has an ambitious goal to revolutionize the API integration process by providing an open infrastructure and 
no-code way to generate SDKs at scale. Our service uses on the one hand the [TypeHub](https://app.typehub.cloud/d/sdkfabric) platform, where every API specification 
is managed and on the other hand the [SDK Fabric](https://github.com/sdk-fabric) GitHub organization where every SDK repository is placed.
